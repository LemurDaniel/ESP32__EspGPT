## 🔗 Built With

> **[ESP32 MiniWebServer Framework](https://github.com/LemurDaniel/ESP32__MiniWebServer-Framework)**
> A lightweight HTTP server framework for ESP32 — routing, LittleFS file serving, WiFi management, and a built-in admin dashboard.
> Add it to any PlatformIO project via `lib_deps` and include `server.h`.

## Overview

This project turns an ESP32 into a tiny always-on web server that lets you boot and shut down a home server (or NAS) from any device on your local network — no SSH, no VPN, no laptop required.

The ESP32 sits permanently on the network and serves a browser-based dashboard. From there you can:

- **Power on** the server by sending a Wake-on-LAN magic packet over UDP.
- **Shut down** the server by calling a remote API endpoint on the server itself.
- **Monitor** whether the server and its services (Gitea, Grafana, Guacamole) are currently reachable.

The dashboard polls the ESP32 every 30 seconds to reflect the current state. A background FreeRTOS task probes the server over HTTPS every 15 seconds and updates an internal state singleton that all HTTP handlers read from.

Because the ESP32 draws only a few milliwatts in idle, it can stay on around the clock while the main server sleeps.

Built with the [ESP32 MiniWebServer Framework](https://github.com/LemurDaniel/ESP32__MiniWebServer-Framework).

May not work with RISC-V based ESP32 variants:
- ESP32-C3
- ESP32-C6
- ESP32-H2

Should work with:
- ESP32 (WROOM, WROVER, CAM ...)
- ESP32-S2
- ESP32-S3
